# Smart Questioning Guidelines

The key to proper learning is not studying, rather practicing and if you're practicing correctly you should be running into glitches, errors, crashes and weird corner cases.

While we as instructors are always present to help you out of such cases, it's mandatory that you have gone through the following steps first, otherwise your question may not be answered or taken seriously.

1. Have either attended all the sessions or watched all the prior recordings
    1. If the issue is related with Git/Github, you must've watched [Tarun's Git Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMntxxpwDqA&list=PLLyazdzLgFw7YKIV7tPhwruafPl388OoN) 
2. Have tried to Google the exact scenario you're in. Most of the times pasting in exact error yields valuable results.
3. Have tried asking on the main WhatsApp group in the format mentioned below and no one has answered you.
4. If the question is assignment related, there's longer than 4 hours left in submission of the assignment

Now asking questions that may yield better responses is an art too. Google doesn't always give you perfect results and that's because you're asking questions like "program no run" which are inherently dumb, have little context and no information on what you tried to do.

Fortunately, there's a simple fix for that. Before asking any question, be it on any platform, try to have the following:

1. Copy and paste the entire error message and your code to https://pastebin.com/ or just send the code file over
2. Explain what you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem. This tells people you’ve already put in some work to figure things out on your own.
3. Specify the point at which the error happens. Does it occur at the very start of the program or only after you do a certain action or line of code?
